# Empty Trash for OS X

Empty Trash is a trash emptying application for OS X that bypasses the `Item in Use` block on file removals.

### Source Description

Empty Trash uses a very simple shell script to remove the OS X trash directories.  The OS X application was built with the open source [Platypus](https://github.com/sveinbjornt/Platypus) application bundling tool.

The shell script source is available [here](https://github.com/chrissimpkins/OSXEmptyTrash/blob/master/src/empty_trash.sh).

### Install

Clone the git repository locally with the command:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/chrissimpkins/OSXEmptyTrash
```

or [download the repository ZIP archive file](https://github.com/chrissimpkins/OSXEmptyTrash/archive/master.zip) and unpack it locally on your system.

Next, drag and drop the Empty Trash.app application in the repository `build` directory to a directory on your OS X system.  The Desktop is a pretty handy site.
