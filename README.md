# Empty Trash for OS X

Empty Trash is a simple trash emptying application for OS X that bypasses the `Item in Use` block on file removal.

### Install

Clone the git repository locally with the command:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/chrissimpkins/OSXEmptyTrash
```

then drag and drop the Empty Trash.app application in the repository `build` directory to a directory on your OS X system.  The Desktop is a pretty handy site.
